    "Former computer teacher for 9 years with the Archdiocese of NY and 13 years as the Technology Director for Dunlevy Milbank Center, Children's Aid NY. Currently enrolled in Empire State, SUNY with an undergraduate from St. Johnâ€™s University. Iâ€™ve created my own curriculum and taught Computer Literacy, Graphic Design, and STEM. Iâ€™ve been trained through the Boys and Girls Club & Microsoft to implement Robotics and coding. Currently, a First LEGO League Coach with an all girls team called Milbotics and Iâ€™m also a Certified Code.org teacher as well. Recently Iâ€™ve also worked with Hostra University with a STEM program called Wise Guys and Gals to facilitate a series of science activities using all general science topics. Iâ€™ve utilized Classroom Inc. for several years, and assisted classroom teachers for 2 years. Working in Harlem and the South Bronxâ€™s my passion, where most students still donâ€™t have access to a computer, and with my instruction students have gained intermediate to advanced skills through the the work. I continue to work in high risk neighborhoods because not having a computer as a student is very stressful, especially in 2018. The divide in the workforce is staggering for young adults and most are lost within a year or two with no computer literacy. My purpose is help put an end to that divide.",
