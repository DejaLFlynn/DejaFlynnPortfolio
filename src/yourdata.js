    "Former computer teacher for 9 years with the Archdiocese of NY and 13 years as the Technology Director for Dunlevy Milbank Center, Children's Aid NY. I’ve created my own curriculum and taught Computer Literacy, Graphic Design, and STEM. I’ve been trained through the Boys and Girls Club & Microsoft to implement Robotics and coding. Prior, a First LEGO League Coach with an all girls team called Milbotics and I’m also a Certified Code.org teacher as well. Recently I’ve also worked with Hostra University with a STEM program called Wise Guys and Gals to facilitate a series of science activities using all general science topics. I’ve utilized Classroom Inc. for several years, and assisted classroom teachers for 2 years. Working in Harlem and the South Bronx’s my passion, where most students still don’t have access to a computer, and with my instruction students have gained intermediate to advanced skills through the the work. The divide in the workforce is staggering for young adults and most are lost within a year or two with no computer literacy.",
